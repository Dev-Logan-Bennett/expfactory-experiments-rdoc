General Task Notes: 
Jaime will be pushing his changes to the nback task (corrected fixation display)
Visual Search, Spatial Cueing, Change Detection, and (maybe) Span Tasks need to be coded, brand new tasks

Task-Specific Notes: 
Stroop Task:
1. Changed way of generated stimuli. Now looping through arrays of colors and words and creating 
jspsych objects. Did this instead so that we don't have to copy and paste the same jspsych object.
2. Caught error that was showing undefined stimuli. Changed so that word stimuli now appears.
3. Caught error showing incorrect feedback after practice trials. Changed so that now shows correct feedback 
for correct/incorrect/null response.
