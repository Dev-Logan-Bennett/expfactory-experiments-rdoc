# Notes on task timing - need to update

# Outline
Practice: 
12 practice trials per block
1 min, 3 max blocks

Test:
48 test trials per block
3 blocks

## TOTAL TIMING W/AVG ITI - these values aren't totally correct b/c some trials don't have equation feedback
Practice = 500ms (fixation) + probe (1000ms) + equation (3000ms) + Equation Feedback (500ms) + blank (1000ms) + 500ms (practice feedback) + 500s (ITI) + response block (until end)
= at least 7000ms
* 12
= 1.4min block (if all equation)

Test = 500ms (fixation) + probe (1000ms) + equation (3000ms) + blank (1000ms) + 500s (ITI) + response block (until end)
= 6000
* 48
4.8 min block
= 14.4 min total time
