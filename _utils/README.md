# From RDoC Grant
1. Copy common.js and helpers.js from this directory.
2. Navigate to `expfactory-deploy` directory on local machine, then `cd expfactory_deploy_local/src/expfactory_deploy_local/static/jspsych7/poldrack-plugins/utils/` and paste in common.js and helpers.js.
   
**These files, common.js and helper.js, serve as utility files for RDoC tasks. They provide shared variables and functions that are used across multiple tasks. However, I might remove these files and instead include the variables and functions directly in each task file, as was done previously.**
